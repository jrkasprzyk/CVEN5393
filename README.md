# CVEN5393

This repository is a work in progress, for the course CVEN 5393: Water Resources Systems and Management, taught by Prof. Joseph Kasprzyk at the University of Colorado Boulder. The examples were started in Spring 2023 and have been continually updated.

Currently the folder structure is:
<ol>
  <li>**Analytic Hierarchy Process**: Several examples that utilize the AHP package in R.</li>
  <li>**Colab Notebooks**: These are Python notebooks intended to be opened in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Each notebook is self-contained and illustrates a principle in water resources and systems analysis.</li>
  <li>**Data**: This folder currently only has one dataset in it. Eventually it may have more examples that can be loaded into the Notebooks or elsewhere.</li>
  <li>**RiverWare Example Models**: Example models implemented in [RiverWare](https://riverware.org/), a river basin and reservoir model developed by the [Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems](https://www.colorado.edu/cadswes/) at the University of Colorado Boulder.</li>
</ol>
