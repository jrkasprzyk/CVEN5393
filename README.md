# CVEN5393: Water Resource Systems and Management

This repository is for the course CVEN 5393: Water Resources Systems and Management, taught by Prof. Joseph Kasprzyk at the University of Colorado Boulder. The examples were started in Spring 2023 and have been continually updated. This is a work in progress and has no guarantee of 

Currently the folder structure is:
1. **Analytic Hierarchy Process**: Several examples that utilize the AHP package in R.
2. **Colab Notebooks**: These are Python notebooks intended to be opened in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Each notebook is self-contained and illustrates a principle in water resources and systems analysis.
3. **Data**: This folder currently only has one dataset in it. Eventually it may have more examples that can be loaded into the Notebooks or elsewhere.
4. **RiverWare Example Models** : Example models implemented in [RiverWare](https://riverware.org/), a river basin and reservoir model developed by the [Center for Advanced Decision Support for Water and Environmental Systems](https://www.colorado.edu/cadswes/) at the University of Colorado Boulder.
