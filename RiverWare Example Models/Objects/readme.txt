This folder contains files for various reservoirs taken from CADSWES training materials. Eventually other reservoir objects may be added.

Use RiverWare's command: Import Objects... to add them to a RiverWare model. Currently, the model-with-imported-objects.mdl shows an example of this.

These reservoir objects could serve as a building block for training examples in this folder as the repo develops.
